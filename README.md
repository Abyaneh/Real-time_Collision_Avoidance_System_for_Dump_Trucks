## Introduction
This project aims to enhance safety in open-pit mining by dynamically adjusting the hazard zone around dump trucks based on vehicle speed and road conditions. The system utilizes **YOLO** for object detection, **segmentation** models for identifying road surfaces, and **Transformers** for analyzing weather conditions like rain or snow. This real-time solution provides visual alerts, optimizing safety by scaling the hazard zone according to both road and speed conditions.

## Features
- **Dynamic Hazard Zone Adjustment**: The hazard zone automatically scales based on vehicle speed and road conditions.
- **Real-Time Road Condition Detection**: Integrates segmentation and Transformers to detect environmental conditions such as rain or snow.
- **Object Detection**: Uses YOLO to detect dump trucks, obstacles, and other objects in real time.
- **Visual Feedback**: Provides immediate, real-time visual alerts with clear hazard zone indicators.
- **Scalable for Industrial Use**: Tailored for large-scale environments like open-pit mines, with real-time adaptability.

## Inputs
- **Camera Feed**: Real-time video input for detecting vehicles and road conditions.
- **Vehicle Speed Data**: Input data from speed sensors or camera-based tracking for determining vehicle velocity.
- **Weather Condition Data**: Road surface detection using segmentation and Transformer models.

## Usage
1. **Run the main application**:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
2. **Real-time Detection**: The system will process the camera feed, detecting both the vehicleâ€™s speed and road conditions in real time.
3. **Visual Output**: The hazard zones (red and yellow) will dynamically adjust based on vehicle speed and road surface conditions (wet, snowy, etc.).

## Results
Testing results in various conditions:
- **Dry Road**: Standard hazard zone adjustment based on vehicle speed.
- **Wet/Snowy Conditions**: Expanded hazard zones to account for decreased control on slippery surfaces.
- **Real-Time Alerts**: Immediate visual cues when entering hazardous zones, enhancing operator awareness and reducing risk.
